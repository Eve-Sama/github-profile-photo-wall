## About size

The most suitable image size for users to upload should be 224px, because the organization line of GitHub can only have seven, each unit is 32px * 32px, and the height is a multiple of 32

Considering that the user can not accurately control the size of the image, the plug-in will adjust the image to the appropriate size ðŸ˜‚ (this is the old interface, the latest version no longer provides a comparison chart)

In a word, no matter how small or how many pictures you upload, you will adjust them to 224px width and 32px multiple height.
