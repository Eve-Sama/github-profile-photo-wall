        <p>
          Because each organization of GitHub is 32px * 32px, and a row can hold 7 organizations at most, so it must be
          7 columns. The width of the appropriate image size should be 224px. As for the height, it should be a multiple
          of 32px. In order to adapt to this requirement, the project will make some changes to the size of your
          uploaded image, adjust the width to 224px by stretching / shrinking, while the height will stretch / shrink
          depending on how many lines you want to generate.
